# Days 10 - 14 of coding with PHP exercises.

I had not been able to put in a full hour of coding the last few days with work and starting an evening college coures. 

So, as I didn't want to give up the coding challenge, dedicated many free hour today to coding. I found a list of php exercises on the internet which I thought would be a good idea to do. 
So, I have been trying to do some of the exercises today from the php code I have learnt over the past week or so in the hours of coding.

I found it quite challengin and rewarding once the code written and outputted correctly. 

I intend to to carry on with the php execises and learning for the rest of the week and see how far I get with completed the tasks.
