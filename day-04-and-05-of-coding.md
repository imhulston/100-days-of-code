# Day 4 and 5 of coding.

I had mised the fourth day through working late. 
I had put in the extra hours on the 5th day (Saturday) whilst full of the flu.

I am still learning/working with variables and arrays. I am really enjoying it. I didn't realise that arrays had built in functions also. 
Aawesome. 
I am going to continue to look into more, with more examples on the 6th day.
