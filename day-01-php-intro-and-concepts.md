#Day one of the 100 day of coding challenge.

I feel the first coding was not spent writing a lot of code as I have begun the journey of learning PHP from scratch. I knew bits of PHP but I want to learn PHP properly from the beginning to fully understand how the language works to give me a solid foundation as I learn more.

So, the first day of the coding challenge was spent more of taking down notes of understanding the main concept and priciples of PHP and the server rather than coding.

Also setting up MAMP so I can view my php files. Also using Markdown files and grasping the basic sintax to provide these short journals for each day. (I hope it displays correctly when viewd. I can always go back and alter any syntax errors.)

I feel great that I have started this journey but also feel like I should of provided more code.

Hopefully day two will have more code to show.
