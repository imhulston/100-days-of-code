### Variable Typing - Day 24

I had not been able to produce a full each day, for the last few days so Day 24 is carrying on from the other day. 
After finishing typing up notes and examples of Multiple Line Commands which I understand and now have began to use that methos to type up notes using PHP code. 

Tonight I have begun learning Variable Typing, which at the moment, I feel lost in undrestanding the concept. tomorrow I  will look for another example and read a bit more to try and make more sense of it.
