#  Day 16 of learning and coding PHP Comparison and Logical Operators

I really enjoyed exploring further php operators. Entering each operator manually to help remember and understand each operator. 
To help further with remembering and understanding I want to attempt some php exercises - Arithmetic operators and Variables, which I am really looking forward to completing. 

I feel a slight progression is ready. This is the reason why I want to work on these exercises over the nect weeks or so to progress, but progress properly. Looking for similar excerses online will be beneficial, the same issues but with different scenarios.
