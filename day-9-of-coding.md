#  Day of 9 off 100 days coding - PHP cariables and arrays.

For some reason, I kept loosing internet connection tonight after updating my macbook last night. 

I worked through the multi-dimensional array. Before I went through tutorial an dread about it. I thought it seemed a bit daunting, after reading how it basically goes, it is a piece of cake. 
I realise there is probably alot we can do alot more we can do with arrays, but I feel fairly confident I can take them to the next level. I will play around around with them more and more over next couple of days just for fun. I quite like working with data.

I going to through the for loop again tonight to see if I fully understand it.. and I do. I am totally over the moon about that.

Again, they are also I want too spend some time with playing around with over the next few days and over the weekend.
