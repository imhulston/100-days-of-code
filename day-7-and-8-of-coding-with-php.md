#  Day 7 and 8 / 100 days of coding - PHP varaibles, arrays and loops.

After trying to continue to work on day 7 with a cold, I decided to go to bed early without completing at least an hour. 

Still with a cold and now a sore throat, but trying to work extra and put the time in for both day 7 and 8.

Plus, I wanted to work on understanding outputing loop values from variables and arrays and other other types of arrays such as the Associative array. 

I still feel some days I should be adding morte code in the hour rather taking noes on my note pad. Hopefully this will alter and more code being written within an hour.

Also, I'm hopng the my cold virus is almost gone tomorrow. The sore throat is now kind of annoying.
