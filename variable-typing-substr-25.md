Completly understand the substr [short for sub string] function now.
Last night, I was not fully understanding what the funtion was doing and the whole point of it as well as how it was converting a number to a string.

During lunch at work today I looked up and tried to research the substr function. 
And now I fully understand how the function works. 

substr(variable/string_name, starting_pos, number_of_characters_to_extracted);

Extracting character from a string.
