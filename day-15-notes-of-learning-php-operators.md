#  Day 15 - Learning php operators.

To continues with learnign php and trying to complete php exercises for beginners. After learning variables and variables with arrays I want to learn and the importance of the php operators which genarally are used with loops. 

I spent some time writing down notes about the operators before getting on to a file and writing some php code (mainly echoing) tonight.
Examples of using basic arithmetic with variables. 

Looking forward to carrying on with operators tomorow.
