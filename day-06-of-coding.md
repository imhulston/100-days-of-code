#  Day 6 of coding - PHP variables and arrays.

Trooping on with a full on cold tonight. 
But, I worked through and now I understanding the for loop and the benefits of what for looping can do that I displayed on the day 6 php file.

Pleased I carried on this evening. Looking forward to learning more tomorrow.

To carry on and get used to working with array(), I should enter what I have to eat tomorrow into an array. Just for fun.
