# Day two of the 100 days of coding - learning PHP.

After working late tonight. I felt exremely tired. I did however push myself to pick up where I left off yester day with php variables with the aid of a glass of water.

I'm glad I did. Once I started I wanted to keep coding as well as taking notes. I really want to learn everything about PHP and work towards building some awesome Apps. Finishing off tonight to set myself up for tomorrows day/night of coding to look at variables in depth structures with strings, arrays and two dimential arrays. 
More water please!!!!!
